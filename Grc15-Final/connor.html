                        <p>
                            Connor is 2 years old born in September of 2020. This little boy is a wonder to watch grow up, as he is absolutely
                            fearless and loves to test the limits on just about everything around him. He loves to climb and jump, often wanting his older brother 
                            to chase him around the house, filling our home with his baby laughter.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            His favorite pass time is snuggling with mama while watching a movie, or playing with his large collection of toy cars. He also is a major foodie and 
                            loves all things that have to do with food. This little boy is just an awe to me and my Husband.
