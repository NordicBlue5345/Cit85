    <h1 class="h2">My Name Is Cassandra</h1>

    <p>I was born in Tulare Ca in 1993. I grew up in the most local cities, the main being</p>

    <ul class="ul2">
      <li>Clovis</li>

      <ul class="ul2">

      As a child I went to Walters, McCardle, Sierra Vista, and Linclon Elementary for grades K-6. 
      After that my family moved and I started at Rio Vista for 7th and 8th. From there I met my forever best friend Stacey, and Nick my Future Husband.
      I have so many wonderful memories growing up and just going wherever me and Stacey thought would be fun that day. 
      Her mom, in a way adopted me and to this day is such a wonderful and amazing woman, and I still call her Mama.

      I moved 2 weeks into my sophmore year and ended up at Clovis North High School. 
      Here I would finish out the remainder of my school years until I graduated in June of 2012.
      To be honest a large part of my journey was kinda boring after that. I moved to Visalia/Tulare and ended up working at a resturant called
      Bravo Farms for a little while.
