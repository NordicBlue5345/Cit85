                        <p>Hello, my name is Cassandra. I am 29 years old and born in the farming town of Tulare. 
                        I am married to my husband Nick and Mother to two wonderful little boys. 
                        I will talk more about them on another page.</p>

                        <p>
                        I have lived in the local cities of Fresno, Clovis, 
                        Tulare and Visalia but it is Clovis North High School,
                        Go Broncos!, that I graduated from in 2012. 
                        From there I have done my best to find my way in this world, 
                        though some moments were harder than others.

            <h2>Meet My Besties</h2>
            <img src="/Grc15-Final/img/stacey.jpg">
                <p> Stacey is my person,
                I have known her since we were 12 years old and she knows me better then anyone else out there.
                I can talk to her on just about anything and she never judges. 
                We can have different views but the love is still there.
                She is more my sister then a friend and even her Mom considers me her daughter.</p>

                <p>My 2nd main Bestie is Sevannah. While we havent known each other for very long, a thing I love about her is she is honest.
                    While I dont always like to hear it, she knows when to tell me im being ridiculous. 
                    I would not be here in College today if she had not pushed me to at least 
                    apply and From there the rest is history.</p>

            <h1>Some Fun Facts about me!</h1>

            <ul id="fun">
                <li><strong>I love the beach</strong></li>
                    <p>One of my favorite places to travel to is Monterey CA. I absolutly love the ocean and all the things that come with it.
                    I love the ocean air and the salty smell, The way the breeze brushes my face, and how the water feels on my feet.
                    Me and my family have made lots of happy memories playing in the sand and being together near the ocean.
                    </p>
                <li><strong>I love Rollercoasters</strong></li>
                    <p>Dispite having a small fear of heights, I love riding rollercoasters. My favorite coaster to ride is Goliath and Batman at Six Flags.
                        One of my fondest memories there is when My best friend Stacey and her family took me with them for the 4th of July and we spent the whole holiday together!
                        Me and Stacey even got matching Capes!
                    </p>

                <li><strong>I am a HUGE Disney fan</strong></li>
                    <p>I am a big disney person. My favorite disney movie is Beauty and the Beast and I collect Disney Mugs.
                        My wedding was Beauty and the Beast inspired and My husband and I shared our 1st dance dancing to the song Beauty and the Beast.
                        Me and my boys love to sing Disney songs in the car all day, right now we sing the Pixar Cars soundtrack on a loop.
