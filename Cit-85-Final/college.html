                <h1 class="page-title">My College Journey</h1>
                        <p>I started my college Journey January of this year. My friend Sevannah made little comments for months about me going to Fresno City
                            and how she could help me get going. She eventually pushed me to just apply to go in November of 2021 and if I chose not to go then their was no harm.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So I applied...
                        </p>

                        <p>To say I was nervous was an understatement. I had heard so many stories of how hard online learning was and how it was not for everyone.
                            while that is true for most cases, it seemed to work really well for me.

            <h2>Degree in Buisness</h2>
                <p>
                    When I started my journey, I started with going for a Associates degree in Buisness. My dream I to one day open up the 
                    cities 1st Cat Cafe. With this Cafe I wanted to provide a safe place for people, support the evergrowing stress on animal shelters,
                    and help struggling familys with children or family members with Autism. By summer I knew a buisness degree itself wasnt the right path for
                    me, so I went in another direction</menu>
                </p>

            <h1>My New Direction!</h1>

            <p>It was becoming apparent that an Associates degree in Buisness wasnt the right path for me. Im a big hands on person, so I needed
                something that could appeal to my artistic side and gave me more hands on experiences. I also needed something that would give me 
                opportunities to be able to still provide motherly support to my kids and financial support with my husband.
                 So with the help of Sevannah, we narrowed it down to Web Development/Design.
