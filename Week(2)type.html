<h1>To My Dear and Loving Husband</h1>

<p>If ever two were one, then surely we.</p>
    If ever man were loved by wife, then thee.
    If ever wife was happy in a man,
    Compare with me, ye women, if you can.</p>
    I prize thy love more than whole mines of gold,</p>
    Or all the riches that the East doth hold.
    My love is such that rivers cannot quench,
    Nor ought but love from thee give recompense.</p>
    Thy love is such I can no way repay;
    The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray.
    Then while we live, in love lets so persever,  
    That when we live no more, we may live ever.</p>

    <p>
        Every night
        before you go to sleep
        I lean down and
        whisper the same sentence.
        
        In a lifetime of questions
        and confusion
        they are the truest words I know.
        
        I am so lucky to be your dad. </p>
