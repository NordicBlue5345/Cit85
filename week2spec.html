<p class="italian"> 
 One of my favorite italian dishes is Simple Spagetti.
 My husbands Nana, may she rest in peace, used to make the most amazing Spagetti ever.
 I craved it so much during my pregnancies and she was always happy to make it when she could.

<div class="one">
    <p class="beach">
        My favorite place to visit is the beach. I love the ocean smell and the way the waves sound as they crash against the sea and rocks.
        I love watching the birds flying high overhead as free as can be. 
        The way the wind blows all around me, gives me a sense of something else is out there. Something more.
